# Section 1: Introduction

For this section, we cover the following things

1. **Credit** -
	Credit Card and Home loans are two very good examples of credit given to a borrower by a lender
	Money in a credit card is not ours, we need to pay it back. If we fail to pay it, we need to repay with interest.
	Home loans are another type of credit given. For this we have a collateral i.e. home itself, this could be used to recover money if the customer fails to pay back.
	Asset financing is another good example of credit/

2. **Credit Risk** -
	Likelihood that the borrower wouldn't repay their loan to the lender is credit risk.
	Collection costs are the costs incurred in recovering back the money that was not collected.
	
3. **Default Event** - 
	A borrower not being able to repay their debt.
